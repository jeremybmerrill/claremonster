<h1>About</h1>
<br></br>
<p><b>5Ception is dedicated to opening channels of communication between Claremont businesses and 5C students to generate new forms of mutually benefical exchange.</b><br></br>While students crave specific services and products, Claremont shops and restaurants continually seek the added business of the 5,000+ person Claremont Colleges community. In order to better serve the needs of students, 5Ception connects Claremont businesses with students in real time, tapping into the student population. When students are inspired by an idea, they can "plant a seed," by posting a request on our website. By listing a product or service, students commit to seriously consider the product if offered. Other students can then "share that person's dream space", by upvoting or comment on the seed, and when seeds reach a certain threshold of upvotes, a business owner can claim the seed by contacting the 5Ception team. It must present an offer, or deal, on the product which we will then send on behalf of the business exclusively to the students that upvoted the seed. Seeds planted, dreams realized, business created.<br></br><b>MIND BLOWN.<br></br>5Ception.</b> </p>
